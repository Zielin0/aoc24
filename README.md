# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 in the [C3 Language](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c).

## Quick Start

To create or run a day use the `aoc.c3` build script.

```sh
$ c3c compile aoc.c3
```

Now to create a day use the following command:
```sh
$ ./aoc new <day>
```

And to run the day use the following command:
```sh
$ ./aoc run <day>
```

Optionally you can run all days at once using `all` as an argument to the run command:
```sh
$ ./aoc run all
```
